AppSimplicity Framework is an open source .Net Platform that accelerates web application development process.

It is based on active record pattern, written in vb.net using .net framework 2.0.

For now it works only with SQLServer 2k/2k5, MySQL and SQLite.  Oracle implementation is in the roadmap.

The idea behind it is to create a platform to generate and extend web applications using .net framework as fastest as posible.
